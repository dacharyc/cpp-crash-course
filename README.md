# C++ Crash Course

This repository is a collection of coding exercises & notes as I work through the book [C++ Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/C-Crash-Course-Josh-Lospinoso/dp/1593278888/) to learn C++.

I'm making it public because I like to learn in the open, with the hope that this can inspire and encourage other learners to be open about their learning journey. None of us are born knowing how to program, and openly sharing struggles and successes can help us build a more inclusive tech industry.
